An exploratory project on website designing.

Find the website at: https://nascentchlorine.github.io/sudoku-info.github.io/

Background: I wanted to learn some website designing. So, I started out with making static webpages using free HTML/CSS templates. That makes the coding work easier. Although, the learning and understanding part comes gradually. So, I combined my love of Sudoku and a passion to create something digital to make a website on Sudoku and its related information.

Free HTML/CSS source: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page296/mediplus-lite
Another Template I used as a login screen: https://colorlib.com/wp/template/login-form-v1/

Feel free to try the templates out and whatever changes I have made while I progress to learning making dynamic webpages.
